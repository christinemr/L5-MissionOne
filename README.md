# Welcome to **Mission One** 🚀

**The digital team at Turners would like to prototype a solution that allows a user to upload the picture of a car and then identify the type of vehicle, with the aim of calculating appropriate insurance premium for the customer based on the car type.**

### 🤓 The Project Brief:

**Your task is to build a cloud-based application that can recognise motor vehicles types (e.g. sedan vs SUV vs truck, or if you want a challenge, try to make your application recognise a few brands and/or models) using a cloud-based AI service on Microsoft Azure (or AWS or Google Cloud). You do NOT need to build the function that calculate premium. You can use code from tutorials you find online, but make sure you read through the code so that you understand the code.**
